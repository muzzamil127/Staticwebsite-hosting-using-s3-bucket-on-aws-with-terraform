# Staticwebsite-hosting-using-s3-bucket-on-aws-with-terraform
In this project i have done these things specifically! 
Provisioned an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting, complete with index.html and error.html.
Uploaded website files to the bucket, making them accessible via the S3 static website endpoint.
Created a dedicated IAM user with custom permissions, ensuring secure and limited access to manage the bucket.
Applied a bucket policy to enable public read access while adhering to AWS best practices.
